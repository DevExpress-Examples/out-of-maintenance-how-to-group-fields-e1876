# How to Group Fields


<p>The following code demonstrates how to combine fields into a group.</p>
<p>In this example, three fields (<em>Year</em>, <em>Quarter</em> and <em>Month</em>, respectively) are combined into a new group. This ensures that the <em>Year</em> field will be followed by <em>Quarter</em> which in its turn is followed by <em>Month</em>. If the <em>Year</em> field is being dragged to another area other fields will be dragged as well.</p>
